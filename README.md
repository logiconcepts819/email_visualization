#Intro
This is a processing applet to visualize email using L-Systems

The L-System is shamelessly stolen from:
http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/49814

TODO fix the style of the code -- right now it's following more a javascripty
style

#To Run
Import the project into eclipse, open the TreeMain class (under src) and then
click the play button.

Click your "email profile", enter in your credentials, and then click the submit
button (submitting via the enter key is currently not implemented).
